    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
            My main hobby I would say is Taekwondo, I started when I was 15 and 
            have competed in multiple competitions such as the All-Ireland's 
            winning gold in sparring. I was on Southern Regional Colleges team 
            for Intervarsity's which is a competition between different colleges, 
            and I went to the Open National Championship where I got a silver
            medal in sparring.

            Long term interest or hobbies I would like to take up in the 
            future would be learning to parachute and then eventually 
            learn how to use wingsuits.
